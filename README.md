# TCP-vs-UDP-Chat-Application
A client–server chat system comparing TCP and UDP communication, analysing reliability, latency, and packet loss.

# What I want to learn
+ Socket Programming
+ Layer differences between TCP and UDP
+ Concurrency between clients
+ Realiability mechanisms
+ Real world trade-offs

# Architecture Overview
2 clients, one UDP and another TCP

Both connect to a Chat Server which then broadcasts messages
